# Crossing-the-road
**Objective: **
        Create an interactive game where the player controls a turtle trying to cross a busy road filled with moving cars. The goal is to reach the other side safely without colliding with any cars.

**Features:**

      Player Control: 
          The player uses the arrow keys to move the turtle up, down, left, and right.
    
      Moving Cars: 
          Cars move horizontally across the screen at varying speeds. The difficulty increases as the player progresses.
          
      Levels: 
          Each successful crossing advances the player to the next level, increasing the speed and number of cars.
          
      Scoreboard:
          A scoreboard displays the player‚Äôs current level and score.

      
**File Structure:**

      main.py: 
          Sets up the game window, initializes game objects, and contains the main game loop.
          
      player.py: 
          Defines the Player class, which handles the turtle‚Äôs movements.
          
      car.py: 
          Manages the creation and movement of cars.
          
      score.py: 
          Keeps track of the player‚Äôs score and level.

      
How to Play:

      Run the main.py file to start the game.
      
      Use the arrow keys to move the turtle.
    
      Avoid the moving cars and reach the other side to advance to the next level.
      
      The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.
    
      
**Requirements:**

      Python 3.x
      
      Turtle graphics library (usually included with Python)
      
      Gameplay: 
          The game window opens with a road and a turtle at the bottom. The player must navigate the turtle across the road while avoiding cars.
      Each successful crossing increases the difficulty, making the cars move faster. The player‚Äôs score and level are displayed at the top of the       screen.


**This project is a fun way to practice Python programming and learn about the Turtle graphics library. Enjoy coding and playing your game! üê¢üöó**
